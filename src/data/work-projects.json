    "description": "Working with art directors, I created an engaging landing page experience for a Covergirl campaign. The main UX challenge was using a different scroll direction without disrupting the user experience. I developed a solution that kept normal user scroll interactions the same, while creating a side scrolling parallax experience. This site was cross browser compatible with IE 8 and early mobile IOS and Android phones.",

I worked with art directors to help craft animations that showed off the Cayenneâ€™s progress traversing the length of South America and the car features that made it possible.  A major challenge for this website was updating the content of the site in almost real time, as soon as the drivers were able to upload images and videos from remote regions of their journey.",
